    <h1>What is Scouting?</h1><br></br>
    <p1>Scouting is a voluntary non-political, non-formal educational movement for young people, open to all without distinction of origin, race, or creed, in<br></br> accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by our Founder, Lord Baden Powell which provides young people with opportunities to<br></br> participate in programmes, events, activities and projects that contribute to their growth as active citizens. Through these initiatives, young people become<br></br>agents of positive change who inspire others to take action.</p1><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br>
